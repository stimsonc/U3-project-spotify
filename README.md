Build week: Unit 3, June 2021

Project description:
Flask app with two main functions: (1) Take a Spotify
song ID and return a visual representation of its audio
features. (2) Use an NLP model to suggest songs that
are similar to one input by the user. 

My contributions:
* I did most of the work building the Flask dashboard, 
including creating the HTML templates. This comprised 
landing and results pages for the visualization and 
prediction features.
* I also got us set up on the Spotify API and figured out
how to pull data from it. I worked with Lucas in creating
the functions in modules.py and predict.py that processed 
data and provided output to be displayed on the browser.
* I worked with the Unit 4 crew to understand, troubleshoot,
and integrate the model.  
  
Future tasks:
* Deploy online. I attempted to do this using Heroku but 
was unsuccessful.
* Improve the model. Unit 3 did not participate in the model, 
but I felt it could be improved through some hyper-parameter
tuning.
